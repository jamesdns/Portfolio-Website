            <p> Pooch Parlor was the first website I created at University. It is a standard website made of HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.</p>
            <p> The website is for a hypothetical dog grooming business, the focus of the coursework was design so some elements were placeholders 
                however the purpose of the website is to show what services Pooch Parlor offers & to allow users to sign in and book their dogs in
                for a grooming session. </p>

            <img src="images/pizzatime2.PNG" class="workImg">
            <p> Pizza Time was the second website I created at University. It was designed for a hypothetical pizza company named Pizza Time and it's 
                purpose was to allow customers to browse Pizza Time's menu, add items to their basket & checkout. There is also a staff section that lets
                staff see open orders and update the status of their order. As this website is responsive, customers, staff and delivery drivers can all 
                use it so the business would be able to operate using this system. </p>
            <p> The website was deployed by Travis CI to Heroku & is connected to a database within MongoDB that stores all the menu items, orders and user
                information. MongoDB Changestreams and WebSockets were implemented so that staff can see live updates of the orders collection and customers
                can see updates on their order via the Ordertracker page.
            </p>
            <p> The website was made with the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JSON, Ajax & MongoDB. </p>
